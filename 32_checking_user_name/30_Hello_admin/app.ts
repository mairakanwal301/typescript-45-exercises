//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
//• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
//• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again


let user_names:string[] = ['bugs bunny','admin','sylvester','tweety','duffy duck'];

for(let i=0; i<user_names.length; i++){
    if(user_names[i] === 'admin'){

      console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    }
    else{
        console.log(`Hello  ${user_names[i]}, thank you for logging in again.`)
